The intercom crackles to life, calling for final preperations and a round of training simulations for the active lancers. Gotta make sure the lancer's gear is up to snuff in case it gets a little hairy planetside. All pilots load up and begin simulations.

The intercom crackles once more, congratulating the team in a good practice run. Along with a successful mission, the team gained a new member of the party, code name Raccoon.
