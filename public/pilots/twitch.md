Soolu Davies was born on a spaceship and as such as developed severe agoraphobia early on in her life. despite that, she got tired of her shipboard life and sought a method to explore planetside while still remaining contained in Metallic Composites. Thus began her life as a Lancer, wherein she was quickly dubbed "Twitch" by her fellow pilots due to her quiet and jumpy personality. She usually keeps to herself and keeps quiet, fading to the background of most situations. She Reads as much as possible, and listens to them any other time to keep herself distracted.

*Other crew have noticed Twitch spends an inordinate amount of her time on, around, or within her mech, talking to herself. She has frequently slept inside Amenity's cockpit or on a cargo net draped from its frame.*
