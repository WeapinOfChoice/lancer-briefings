# Mission // #001
## Red Hand's Reach

Something, or someone, reached out to the CO during the training sim, asking for assistance. A lancer working for HORUS is wounded, and needs rescue. His custom frame has him in stasis, but its not going to last very long.
The subaltern referred to itself as a "Hand of God" and asked that they save the pilot and confirm the intel he was carrying is still with him. They will be assisting with comms when the mission begins. Prepare to suit up and head planetside to rescue this pilot.

# Goals
1. Secure important intel.
2. Rescue the injured pilot.

# Stakes
- Failure to secure the necessary cargo will result in penalties when working with HORUS. Lets make a good first impression pilots.

### Rewards
- Support in a future mission by the HORUS agent hiring us.

### Penalties
- Reduced confidence in the HORUS agent interacting with us.
  
# Reserves
- None at this time.
